TEST TEXT
===============================================================================
This is just a bunch of test text so that I can show that the text file reading
mode works.

I guess it would be nice if you could jump to different parts of the file or
something along those lines. Maybe if there was some kind of way that it could
identify headings then the help command would be able to let you choose
a heading to go to somehow. On the other hand you could just configure there to
be multiple help files with each having a fairly specific topic and then you
could choose which one of those files you would want to have a nice read of.

I am going to wear a smallish hat. Just big enough that the hat looks very
powerful and very beautiful you know exactly what kind of hat I am talking
about I think.
