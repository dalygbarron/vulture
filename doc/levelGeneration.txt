LEVEL GENERATION
================

The difficult thing about level generation is not so much thinking up
algorithms for making the shape of the dungeons, as for this simpleish game it
should not be too hard; the difficult thing is figuring out how to link enemies
into it.

I think that we must have generalised algorithms that are written into the
code, and then we should have configured "areas" which make use of an
algorithm but also change the kinds of materials the area is built with and
that kind of thing.

I think that for each spot on the floor that it creates, it should have to call
a function that tells it what enemy if any to place on that spot in on the
floor. It can then use a bunch of logic such as proximity to certain
substances like water or fire, and proximity to previously added enemies in
order to decide what kind of enemy. Social enemies will more likely to be closer
together and such.

There could also be special flags added to a certain floor or dungeon like "is
inhabited by humans" which might make it that no wild creatures spawn, or "is
infected by disease" which would make diseased creatures spawn.

Oh yeah, it will obviously have to do this enemy adding as a final pass over
the generated level. This is somewhat problematic as it will be slow as piss.

Also, occasionally you are just going to want to add the enemies earlier for
example when you have a nice little thing like an enemy camp in a desert or
a king on his throne. You cannot leave that stuff to chance.
