GENERATION
===============================================================================

Obviously I do not want to generate every single map in the game at the same
time because that would take a long time, and also certain maps might not even
exist until they are created by digging or whatever.

Every map will have a location in 3D space, and when a new map is created it
will look at it's location in relation to other maps and the things that those
other maps have that are inter map related (for example up and down staircases,
waterfalls and sinkholes and stuff), and it can make a decision as to whether
it wants to include them in the map, and if it does then it will then be
a requirement that those locations are covered by this map and they have the
right stuff like stairs if needed.

Actually, rather than being an initial decision, I think I should just make it
that if the map happens to pass over an unclaimed staircase then it can choose
to claim it and put a staircase there.

I feel a little worried about things overwriting staircases and stuff like
that, but I can just code a logging error right into the tile setting function
when you overwrite a claimed staircase. If the staircase is nto claimed it does
not really matter.

There should also be cases where a staircase reserves itself for a specific
type of thing, for example if there is a level with three staircases, but one
of them is a special staircase to a treasure room or something, and the other
two are just normal staircases. In this case, the special staircase should not
be able to be claimed by anything. I will come back to this idea.

Also, levels should be generated in advance, meaning that when you enter the
first level of the game it should generate all of the levels that connect to
the first level, and when you enter those levels it generates the levels
connected to them, and it should store a flag as to whether a level has been
entered by the player yet or not. The advantage of doing this is that until
a level has been entered by the player, it can still be edited, so if two maps
are on the same height and position, we can add a staircase between them
somewhere if we want. I think we should do so with %50 likelihood on average,
but other things might change that likelihood considerably.

EXAMPLE
===============================================================================

First level is a big courtyard with four stairways up, one stairway down to
the dungeons, one stairway down to the kitchen, and one stairway down to the
vault. All of the connecting levels are then generated, so for the up
staircases, it will generate a level above which may also cover some of the
other up staircases in which case it may claim them. If two of the up floors
overlap then it may also create a passageway between them. It will choose the
style of these up levels simply based on height number and the current "biome"
type thing we are in which is castle.

For the down to gold it will know that this staircase is meant to lead to gold
so it will create a gold room.

STORING MAPS DURING GENERATION TIME
===============================================================================

During generation time in this game we do not know in what directions the map
will stretch. In fact, that may also be true of in game, if we want a super
large overworld, obviously we will have to load it in portions.

Therefore, we will need to have a nice quadtree that stores the maps. Hmmm that
kind of sucks because it will make lookup somewhat slower, especially since
I will need to do it for each bloody thing. yeah fuck that, I will just add
horizontal doors between areas that are at the same elevation.

Horizontal doors everywhere is awful. I will not do that.
