SCRIPTING
===============================================================================

At some point in development I am going to want a dev console thingy where
I can type in stuff to edit the map and add fancy shit to myself etc. Obvsiouly
since this game is explicitly avoiding scripted content, embedding a scripting
language solely so that I can do dev console shit is way over the top, so
therefore, I have thought of a design for a real basic one I can implement
quickly myself.

It will be a stack language and do everything in a single pass (except when it
executes strings, as it will pass over it once as a string, and then when you
execute it it passes over it again as code).

In order to allow logic structures without messing around with the nice simple
one pass thing, I am going to make it that all code blocks are actually
interpreted as strings and placed upon the stack, then after the block is
placed on the stack you will have methods to execute it. If you want to call
a function you will load the function text from a global variable onto the
stack, and then execute it.

In order for this to work nestedly, the { character will actually mean start
string, and } will mean end string, and these will be parsed nestedly, so {{}}
will return the string {} rather than { (and an error). You can also used " for
normal strings though as it would be kinda weird otherwise and you would have
to escape { and }.

There will not be any scope for named variables, I think local variables are
replaced by the stack. For global variables there are three prefixes; =, $, and
!. =name means set variable name to top value on stack. $name means push value
of variable name on top of stack. !name means push value of name on top of
stack and then immediately execute it as code.

It would be good if the game exposed some global variables for stuff like the
pointer location if you are in look mode, and the values of the registers if
that is actually useful. I think that it should be possible to use this
scripting language to transition from one program mode to another and do all of
that kind of stuff.

There should also be a default set of variables to set so that I can load in
some functions I want by default. I was thinking of having an rc file type
thing but that would actually be kind of a pain in the ass, so instead I think
I will create a dictionary of these variables out of an .ini file, as the
script runner will use a dictionary as well, so it can just start with that
dictionary and build from it.

Obviously, performance is not going to be remotely impressive, but that is
beside the point, I do not intend for it to have any use within gameplay which
is an idea I hold very strongly. Also if by some psychotic episode I did decide
to add scripted content into the actual game, I would just embed an actual
scripting language. This one is to be created purely because embedding
scripting languages is a pain in the balls and a lot of fuss and pomp so
I would rather keep the code my own when it's only going to be used by dev
tools for me.

Here are some examples of how I imagine it.

===============================================================================

{"tango is a " swap concat print} =tango
{"tool" "idiot" {swap} 0 1 randint 0 equal execif pop} =word

!word !tango

# This bit of code defines a function called tango and a function called word.
# The tango function takes a string from the stack and concatenates it onto the 
# end of a string that says "tango is a ..." and then prints it, and the word
# selects randomly either the word tool or idiot and places it on the stack.
# Placed together, the code will print either "tango is a tool" or "tango is
# a idiot"

===============================================================================

{printnum} 0 100 range

# This one should print the numbers 0 to 100.

BUILT IN COMMANDS
===============================================================================

swap: switch the top item on the stack with the second from top item.
dredge: takes a number off the top of the stack, then takes the item that
        deep within the stack and puts it on top of the stack.
print: outputs the string on top of the stack.
exec: executes the string on top of the stack as a block of code.
execif: takes a boolean off the top of the stack and then executes the string
        under it if the boolean was true. removes both from stack either way.
dup: takes the top item off the stack and makes there be two of it on top of
     the stack.
=XXX: sets the value of global variable XXX to whatever is on top of the stack.
@XXX: puts the value of global variable XXX on top of the stack.
!XXX: executes the code block in global variable XXX.
concat: takes a string from the top of the stack and combines it with the next
        string on the stack and then puts the result on the stack.
add: adds the two numbers on top of the stack.
sub: subtracts the two numbers on top of the stack.
mult: multiplies the two numbers on top of the stack.
div: divides the two numbers on top of the stack.
type: takes top item from stack and replaces it with it's type number.
eq: takes two values from the stack and adds a boolean for whether or not they
    are equal.
ne: takes two values from the stack and adds a boolean for inequality.
gt: takes two values from the stack and adds a boolean for if the first is
    greater than the second.
