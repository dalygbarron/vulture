STEALTH
===============================================================================

Not really sure how this is going to work yet, just going to write down the
sort of things that I want to happen.

If enemies have not seen you then they will just be in looking around mode, not
going straight for you. Once they see you they will go for you and will alert
all other enemies that are within seeing distance of them.

If you are dressed like a member of their faction you can probably get away
with pretending to be one of them most of the time, though maybe there will be
cases where that will not work, like if you get too close so that they can
recognise you, or if they are already in angry mode.

Also, if you are dressed like a servant but are carrying a bunch of weapons and
shit they will also attack you, so you will have to stash that kind of stuff
when you are trying to be sneaky.

Also it would be nice if you could bribe guards, but if you can't talk to them
without them attacking you I don't know how that would work. In a game like
this I am not sure what other use money is going to have. Maybe it won't have
any use.
