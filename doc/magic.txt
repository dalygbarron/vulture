MAGIC
===============================================================================

I have heard about magic systems in which there is no mana, you just have to
"prepare" spells, and they are then stored in slots, and then you fire them
from their slot. (Though presumably for convenience this could be streamlined
to a single step for situations where that would be useful).

The preparation step will take a great amount of time which means that the user
will be trading resources like food, and their own safety in order to prepare
the spells. You will not be able to be interrupted while preparing a spell
either since it would be hard to accomodate for in the game loop and also
because I figure you are probably in a trance or something, so if something
gets into the room where you are preparing spells you could easily die.

Yeah I am quite psyched about this, I think it would be rather fascinating to
try and build a character who is fairly low health and physical strength, but
try to manage their prepared spells and scrolls and shit in order to be able to
get in and kill the cunts and get out.

So you will have some fixed number of spell slots as well which will be
increased by increasing your knowledge level, and maybe also by equipping some
special items that increase your number of slots.

There could also be items that automatically prepare a skill and store it in
themselves like a magic sword that occasionally lets you cast a fireball or
whatever. That would be pretty cool.

In order to be able to prepare a spell, you would need to have a book of that
spell. You can also get a scroll of that spell which lets you cast it
instantaneously, but I will just have to balance it so that they are not common
enough that you can rely on them for anything.
